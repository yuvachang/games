## Minesweeper

Interprets the original game that shipped with early Windows and maintains fidelity to those controls. 
Built in React.js and hosted on Firebase.

Features:
Single mouse click to uncover cell. 
Right click to mark with flag or '?'. 
Middle click (or Left-AND-Right click) to open all adjacent cells if flags have been placed. 
First click will never be a mine and will always trigger uncovering of neighboring cells to improve experience.
Scoreboard to track best times.
